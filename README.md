# GOAL SETTER - TO-DO List

This is a simple yet powerful To-Do List app built using **SwiftUI**. The app allows users to add, edit, delete, and manage tasks with reminders, due dates, and priorities (High, Medium, Low). The app also features task completion toggling, allowing users to mark tasks as completed or incomplete easily.

## Features

- **Add New Tasks**: Users can easily create new tasks by typing in the task description, setting a due date and time, assigning a priority (High, Medium, Low), and optionally setting a reminder.
  
- **Edit and Update Tasks**: Click on any task to edit the description, update the priority, change the due date, or modify any task information as needed. After editing, click **Done** to save changes.

- **Delete Tasks**: To delete a task, click on the **Delete Icon** displayed next to the task. You can also swipe left on a task to remove it from the list.

- **Complete Tasks**: Tap on the **Radio Button** beside any task to mark it as complete. The button will show a checkmark when the task is completed. Unchecking it will move the task back to active.

- **Reminders**: Set reminders for tasks with specific date and time, so you wonâ€™t miss any deadlines.

- **Task Prioritization**: Set task priorities as **High**, **Medium**, or **Low** to organize your tasks based on importance.
